# How to Run Source File
Sometimes, the application can have all kinds of weird problems. In this case, it is better to run the source code directly. The following steps are written for macOS, as `Python` is pre-installed on every mac.
1. Open the Terminal.app, which is located in /Application/Utilities folder.

2. Type `python ` (there is a space after it) in terminal, then drag the file to the Terminal window.
3. Press `enter`.
Note: In this case, the program is attached to the terminal. To terminate the program, simply send keystroke `Ctrl`+`c` to the terminal window or close the terminal winow directly.
